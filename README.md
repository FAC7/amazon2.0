# Style guide & Conventions
We are adhering to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard). For Atom, install the [linter-js-standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) extension and disable your other JavaScript linters.

The main style conventions are:
* 2 space indentation
* No semi-colons
* At most 1 blank line between blocks of code

All code should adhere to the style guid (which means no linter warnings!) and result in a passing [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/FAC7/amazon2.0) build.
