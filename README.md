# What
This project is developed by all FAC7 cohort members from [Founders and Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/)

This website, modeled on Amazon, is being built in order to learn React and also apply the other technologies we have learnt since we started the course.

# How
We split into groups of four people, each team is in charge of a different component of the webpage. We are going to develop ```React Components``` in order to re-use them in future projects.

# Technology used

* React.js
* Hapi.js
* Node.js
* Redis

(the RHNR stack? :joy:)

# Roles
## Code Reviewers

* @franzmoro
* @JackTierney
* @oturnermajor

Set up badges, file structure, travis build and have final say of what is merged to master and what is not.

## POs

* @KatBow
* @andrewMacmurray
* @MyPitit

Setting up tasks and summarising where we are at.

# Project Documentation
This README is the main source of project documentation. Please update it with everything required to contribute to the project.

The [wiki](https://github.com/FAC7/amazon2.0/wiki) is the other source of project documentation, where technical details of parts of the project should be documented so that all team members can get to grips with any part of the project.

# Style guide & Conventions
We are adhering to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard). For Atom, install the [linter-js-standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) extension and disable your other JavaScript linters.

The main style conventions are:
* 2 space indentation
* No semi-colons
* At most 1 blank line between blocks of code

All code should adhere to the style guid (which means no linter warnings!) and result in a passing [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/FAC7/amazon2.0) build.
